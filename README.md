## Getting Started

It's a school project, so it's not perfect. We are three students working on this project. We are French, so the game is in French. We are not professionals, so the code is not perfect. We are open to any suggestions, so don't hesitate to contact us. We are not responsible for any problems that may.

## Prerequisite
You need to install the dependencies with the following commands:
```sh
pip install tkinter
pip install copy
pip install pygame
pip install signal
pip install pillow
pip install tile
```
